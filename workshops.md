### Bursaries

Thanks to the generous support of the [Institute of Museum and Library Services Laura Bush 21st Century Librarian Program Planning Grant](https://www.imls.gov/grants/awarded/re-11-19-0047-19), the NYDCLC is able to offer a *limited number* of bursaries to help offset travel costs for those who otherwise might not be able to attend the workshops. The NYDCLC will reimburse travel costs (including mileage, transportation, food, and/or hotel costs, etc.) up to $400. If you would like to be considered for a bursary, please send an email to nycarpentries@gmail.com and provide your name, institutional affiliation (if any), an estimate of travel costs to attend the workshop, and a brief statement about what you hope to gain from the workshop. *The bursary application deadline is February 21; notifications will be sent out by February 28.*
